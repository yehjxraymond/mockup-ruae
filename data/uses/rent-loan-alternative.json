    {
      "question": "How is Rently different from a rent loan?",
      "answer": "Unlike traditional rent loans from banks, Rently doesn't charge compound interest or add debt to your credit report. We charge a simple, transparent service fee. There are no early repayment penalties, and approval is much faster than bank loans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will using Rently affect my credit score?",
      "answer": "Rently performs a soft credit check that doesn't impact your credit score. Traditional bank loans require hard inquiries that can temporarily lower your score. With Rently, your debt-to-income ratio isn't affected either."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I want to pay off early?",
      "answer": "You can pay off your remaining balance anytime with zero penalties. Unlike bank loans that often charge early settlement fees, Rently encourages early repayment and makes it easy to do so through your dashboard."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I finance through Rently?",
      "answer": "Rently can cover annual rent payments typically ranging from AED 30,000 to AED 500,000, depending on your income and eligibility. We'll let you know your approved amount during the application process."
