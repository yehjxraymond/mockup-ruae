        "answer": "Yes, your landlord receives the full annual rent payment upfront or in up to 6 cheques as per the lease agreement. This is the core benefit of Rently's service - landlords get their preferred payment structure while you gain the flexibility of monthly payments.

Your monthly payments are made to Rently, not directly to the landlord.",
