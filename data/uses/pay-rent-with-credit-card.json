    },
    {
      "question": "Will my landlord know I'm paying with a credit card?",
      "answer": "No, your landlord receives a standard bank transfer from Rently. They don't need to have a card terminal or accept card payments directly. The payment method is seamless and transparent for both parties."
    },
    {
      "question": "What credit cards are accepted?",
      "answer": "We accept all major credit cards including Visa, Mastercard, and American Express issued by UAE and international banks. Debit cards are also accepted but may not offer the same rewards benefits."

    {
      "question": "Are there any fees for paying rent with a credit card?",
      "answer": "Rently charges a transparent service fee that is clearly disclosed before you commit. For most users, the credit card rewards earned exceed the service fee, making it a net positive financial decision."

    {
      "question": "How quickly is my landlord paid?",
      "answer": "Once your payment is processed, we transfer funds to your landlord within 1 business day. Your landlord receives full payment on time, every time."
